# Third Party Codes

This directory includes all the resources from the third party. For example, some chip manufacturers have their own drivers introducing the usage of their chips. In case that we may have to modify some of the codes while using, this directory serves as backups to those modification.

Note that the codes I used here are mainly from the open source libraries by chip manufacturers. I may NOT share the copyrights to the entire library. If any reference violates the regulations, rules, or law, please contact me via kirk_z@yeah.net. I will resolve the issue(s) as soon as possible.

Thanks for your understanding and supports.
